Eroded by the waves of the [[Sea of Ghosts]] and the [[Balothian Bay]], the Northern Coast of High Rock is an inhospitable land of grey cliffs, fjords and cold gravel beaches, and the Breton dwellers of this region are hardy and earnest people.
The Northern Coast is split between the Kingdom of Northpoint, the Kingdom of Farrun and the Kingdom of Jehanna, but the true master of the region is the Skyrim [[Kingdom of Solitude]] that rules it through military, diplomatic and trade domination.
