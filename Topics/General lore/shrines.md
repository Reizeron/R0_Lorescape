Shrines are sanctified objects where the humble and faithful may communicate more directly with their gods. They can be found either inside the [[regional temples]] of the Nine Divines or as the [[wayshrines]] or [[standing stones]] in the country. The faithful and respectful guests may make offerings and receive blessings at shrines; the faithful of higher ranks need make no offering to receive blessings.
