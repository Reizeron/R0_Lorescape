>Cremation of the dead has been the tradition in High Rock ever since the days of the necromancer witch-kings and still dominates in the more rural parts of the province. In the urban and cosmopolitan Iliac Bay, an Imperial-style burial in a family crypt, a town cemetery or a temple undercroft is more common. On [[Balfiera]], the members of the ruling clan are interred on the higher levels of the [[Direnni Tower]], while their retainers are laid to rest inside the many local mausoleums.
