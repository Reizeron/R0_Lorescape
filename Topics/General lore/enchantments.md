>Temple enchanters favor healing and protection spells. Redoran enchanters favor wounding missile loads and shield spells. Hlaalu like weapon enchantments and various spell rings. Imperials use a wide array of weapon and ring damage enchantments. But the masters of enchantment are the Telvanni. They use all effects, often several combined on one item, but they especially like items that summon creatures or magical weapons and armor.
