Class;Noble
I am a noble, elevated by birth and distinction to the highest ranks of Imperial society. I do not have a trade, as such, though I may dabble in various affairs, collecting rare treasures of beauty and refinement. And if such things are valuable, there's no harm in it. My lofty station is not without responsibilities, of course. I must serve at the command of the Emperor and the Councils, giving counsel and support, and, when duty calls, taking spell and sword to protect the smallfolk of the Empire.
*;Noble; generic [Imperial]; make sure more specific Great House noble topics are above this one*

Class;Savant
I am a savant. I am a man of wide learning and cosmopolitan tastes, a well-traveled man, educated, refined in manner, able to converse on various topics with authority, and a man ever ready to defend his honor, and the honor of my companions. In short, you see before you a gentleman. I can discourse upon history, speechcraft, language, and customs. And, for a fee, I offer training that will permit you to share a few of my many virtues.
*;Savant; MALE; History, Speechcraft, Language and Usage in Modern Morrowind*

Class;Knight Province;Morrowind
I'm a knight. In the West, you need a horse and land to be a knight, but here, we have no horses, and all you need is good armor, good weapons, and the skill to use them. I prefer to fight with axes and shields. Since I live by my weapons, I have to pay careful attention to local feelings about [[killing and murder]] -- what's right and what's wrong.
*;Knight; Axe, Shields, killing and murder*

Class;Commoner Province;Morrowind
I am a commoner. I do whatever needs doing -- cooking, cleaning, building, baking, making, breaking. And, by your accent, I can tell YOU are an outlander. Since you're new to these parts, perhaps you'd like me to share a little local lore.
*;Commoner; Morrowind lore, local lore*

Class;Merchant
I am a merchant. I look for goods that are well-made, that people want to buy, that I can buy and sell at a profit. There are many different kinds of materials I can buy and sell -- [[animal products]], [[vegetable products]], [[mineral products]], even [[exotic products]]. Crafts and manufactured goods I deal in include weapons, armor, clothing, books, potions, enchanted items, and various housewares. I travel, talk with people I meet, buy what I like, and sell what people like.
*;Merchant; generic merchants do not have services, and do not buy and sell; they are just merchant quest and scenery characters*
