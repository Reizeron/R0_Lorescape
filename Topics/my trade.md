Class;Noble
I am a noble, elevated by birth and distinction to the highest ranks of Imperial society. I do not have a trade, as such, though I may dabble in various affairs, collecting rare treasures of beauty and refinement. And if such things are valuable, there's no harm in it. My lofty station is not without responsibilities, of course. I must serve at the command of the Emperor and the Councils, giving counsel and support, and, when duty calls, taking spell and sword to protect the smallfolk of the Empire.
*;Noble; generic [Imperial]; make sure more specific Great House noble topics are above this one*

Class;Savant
I am a savant. I am a man of wide learning and cosmopolitan tastes, a well-traveled man, educated, refined in manner, able to converse on various topics with authority, and a man ever ready to defend his honor, and the honor of my companions. In short, you see before you a gentleman. I can discourse upon history, speechcraft, language, and customs. And, for a fee, I offer training that will permit you to share a few of my many virtues.
*;Savant; MALE; History, Speechcraft, Language and Usage in Modern Morrowind*

Class;Knight Province;Morrowind
I'm a knight. ==In the West==, you need a horse and land to be a knight, ==but here, we have no horses==, and all you need is good armor, good weapons, and the skill to use them. I prefer to fight with axes and shields. Since I live by my weapons, I have to pay careful attention to local feelings about [[killing and murder]] -- what's right and what's wrong.
*;Knight; Axe, Shields, killing and murder*

Class;Commoner Province;Morrowind
I am a commoner. I do whatever needs doing -- cooking, cleaning, building, baking, making, breaking. And, by your accent, I can tell YOU are an ==outlander==. Since you're new to these parts, perhaps you'd like me to share a little local lore.
*;Commoner; Morrowind lore, local lore*

Class;Crusader
I'm what they call a crusader. Crusaders used to be warriors in service to a cult, but now any heavily armored warrior with a good cause calls himself a crusader. My good cause is hunting down [[necromancers]] and witches and bandits and other malefactors. And I do well by doing good -- salvage on arms, armor, and goods taken from malefactors earns me a good living. I'm tough and strong, so I wear heavy armor and use blunt weapons. And I won't fight with worn weapons or worn armor, so I'm my own armorer.
*;Crusader; Blunt, Heavy Armor, Armorer*

Class;Witchhunter
I am a witchhunter. I dedicate body and soul to the destruction of profane magics. Most foul are [[necromancers]], who defile the bodies and spirits of the sacred dead. Equally abominable are the evil Daedra worshippers. The Daedra Lords delight in the torment and corruption of mortals, and they reward followers with terrible powers always used for evil purposes. In employing the tools of the Enemy -- the spells of the College of Conjuration -- I risk contamination, but fire must be fought with fire.
*;Witchhunter; Daedra, Necromancy*

Class;Witch Author;R-Zero
I'm a witch. I have bound myself by oath and deed to the service of a Daedra lord, and in return have received gifts of knowledge and power. If you are curious, and not afraid, I can tell you a little about the Daedra and [[Daedric summonings]].

Class;Witch Province;Morrowind
I'm a witch. I have bound myself by oath and deed to the service of a Daedra lord, and in return have received gifts of knowledge and power. ==The Temple calls my patrons the bad Daedra, and perhaps they aren't very nice... but I guess I'm not very nice, either.== If you are curious, and not afraid, I can tell you a little about the ==bad Daedra== and Daedric summonings.
*;Witch; Daedra, Necromancy*

Class;Scout
I'm a scout. I know places, people, plants, paths, wind, and weather. I serve as guide for travelers and traders, or work as advance guard and pathfinder for expeditions. I know the [[geography of High Rock]], and the various [[geographic regions]]. My best defense is stealth, sneaking past trouble, but I can fight bow or blade, in various armor styles, when the job requires it.

*;Scout; Geography*

Class;Agent Province;Morrowind
I'm an agent. I work for a ==House==, or a company, or the state, and I do things that need doing. All sorts of things. Mostly I handle matters in the business or diplomatic line, things that require mercantile skills, or the arts of speechcraft. I trade in knowledge -- hard facts and rumors. 'Knowledge is power,' as they say. And sometimes I do other sorts of things. Things I can't talk about.
*;Agent; Rumors, Mercantile*

Class;Pilgrim
I am a pilgrim. I search for enlightenment, and hope to purify my soul through facing and overcoming the challenges of [[pilgrimages]] that reenact the tests and trials of gods, saints, and heroes. I visit the [[shrines]] and make devotions everywhere I travel...

Class;Pilgrim Province;Morrowind
I am a pilgrim. I search for enlightenment, and hope to purify my soul through facing and overcoming the challenges of pilgrimages that reenact the tests and trials of gods, saints, and heroes. I visit the shrines and make devotions everywhere I travel -- ==in village Temple shrines, and the High Fane of Vivec, or at the remote shrines scattered all over Vvardenfell.==
;Pilgrim; Shrines, Pilgrimages

Class;Bookseller Province;Morrowind
I'm a bookseller. I buy and sell books. I also read books, and know the sorts of things you read in books. I don't mind sharing what I know about ==Morrowind lore==, and am happy to share a little advice, if you're interested. I can also suggest who to talk to if you want to know more about a subject.
;Bookseller; History, Who to talk to.

Class;Farmer
I am a farmer. I grow crops, and raise animals for food, and gather [[animal products]] and [[vegetable products]] from the land for my own use or for sale at the markets.
*;Farmer; animal products and vegetable products;*

Class;Bard
I am a bard. As an entertainer, I share songs and stories with patrons and peasants. As a scholar, I travel the world, speaking with people, and learning the lessons of history and human nature. And because a good bard must experience adventure at first hand in order to present its drama effectively, I have learned to defend myself with the noble tools of medium armor and long blade, and have mastered minor mysteries of alchemy, enchantment, and illusion.
*;Bard; History, Speechcraft, Teach Ballads*

Class;Thief
I'm a thief. I was born to be a thief. I love to sneak around in rich people's houses, and liberate their possessions. I enjoy puzzling out the security provisions on doors and chests, thrilling to the challenge and suspense of picking locks and disarming traps. And I've always had an interest in [[Imperial law]] -- property rights, criminal justice, bribes and graft. Me and the guards, we're old friends. And punitive labor isn't all that bad -- free food and board, fresh air, and good fellowship.
*;Thief; Sneak, Security. Imperial law*

Class;Barbarian
I'm a barbarian, and proud of it. I like the wilderness, and know how to live comfortably off the land. I know the various creatures of the wild, how to hunt them, what bits are good to eat, and what bits the city-folk will pay for. I know weapons and armor, and how to stay healthy, so I can play soldier for pay. But I hate taking orders, so I rather live by hunting.
*;Barbarian; Wildlife*
*Replace "various creatures" with "various [[native creatures]]" - R-Zero*

Class;Hunter Province;Morrowind
I am a hunter. I range across the ==ashlands== and wastes, hunting for meat and hides. I know the [[native creatures]] of ==Vvardenfell==, and know to avoid the diseased creatures, and the blighted creatures, for they are foul and worthless, and deadly to the careless hunter. ==I know the Ashlands and the Grazelands, Azura's Coast and Molag Amur==, and can tell you of these places.
*;Hunter; Ashlands geography*
*Add a High Rock version - R-Zero*

Class;Merchant
I am a merchant. I look for goods that are well-made, that people want to buy, that I can buy and sell at a profit. There are many different kinds of materials I can buy and sell -- [[animal products]], [[vegetable products]], [[mineral products]], even [[exotic products]]. Crafts and manufactured goods I deal in include weapons, armor, clothing, books, potions, enchanted items, and various housewares. I travel, talk with people I meet, buy what I like, and sell what people like.
*;Merchant; generic merchants do not have services, and do not buy and sell; they are just merchant quest and scenery characters*
