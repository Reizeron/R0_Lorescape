Class;Savant Province:Morrowind
The ten races commonly encountered in Morrowind are: Redguard, Breton, Nord, Altmer, Dunmer, Bosmer, Imperial, Khajiit, Argonian, and Orc. Dunmer are the native majority, but on Vvardenfell, heavily colonized by Imperial outlanders, only one in two individuals are Dunmer. The other nine races are about equally distributed, with more Argonian and Khajiit slaves. As mercenaries, House Hlaalu prefers Imperials and Redguards, Redoran prefers Nords and Altmer, and Telvanni prefer Bosmer and Bretons.
