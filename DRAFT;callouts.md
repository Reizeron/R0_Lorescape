I am a merchant. I look for goods that are well-made, that people want to buy, that I can buy and sell at a profit. There are many different kinds of materials I can buy and sell -- animal products, vegetable products, mineral products, even exotic products. Crafts and manufactured goods I deal in include weapons, armor, clothing, books, potions, enchanted items, and various housewares. I travel, talk with people I meet, buy what I like, and sell what people like.
*;Merchant; generic merchants do not have services, and do not buy and sell; they are just merchant quest and scenery characters*

>[!dialogue] Class;Necromancer Faction;Worm-Cult Author;R-Zero
I am a necromancer, an anointed priest of our Lord and Teacher, the God of Worms. I partake in His Transcendent Wisdom and learn the mysteries of souls and how to bring dead to life, and by His Red Wisdom I put the live ones to death. I disregard the superstitious burial practices of the unenlightened, which earns me their scorn, so as ordained, I stay Hidden when I must. I can illuminate you on the holy craft of necromancy or teach you how to take care of undead creatures.
*;necromancer, worm cultist*

>[!dialogue] Class;Necromancer Author;R-Zero
I am a necromancer. Mastery of the College of Conjuration allows me to commune with all things dead, and I am the one to call when you have to deal with hauntings, both natural and unnatural. In case that fails, I also know how to exploit weak points of undead creatures using the College of Destruction. People of my profession are not liked by the common folk, so I have to learn how to stay out of sight. If you so desire, I can tell you more about necromancy, or the local burial practices.

High Rock is the northwesternmost province of the Tamrielic Empire. It borders Skyrim in the east and has a long land and sea border with Hammerfell in the south. It is bounded by the Sea of Ghosts and Balothian Bay on the north, Iliac Bay on the south and the Eltheric Ocean on the west. The Bjoulsae river serves as a natural border with Hammerfell, with High Rock occupying its rugged right bank.
**(continue)**
The majority of High Rock's population lives in the hospitable western peninsula of Greater Bretony which is separated from the wilder, harsher regions of Western Reach and the Northern Coast by the peaks of the Wrothgarian Mountains. The Isle of Balfiera and the Dellese Isles are located in the Iliac Bay and off the Northern Coast respectively.
