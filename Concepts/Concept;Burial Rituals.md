> ==It is common practice to burn the corpses of our fallen foes.== This is as much a necessity as it is custom, for death brings with it disease and dread. Our chieftains wished to cleanse Solstheim of the Elven horde, in death as well as life. It was decided, however, that such was not to be the fate of the Snow Prince. One so mighty in war yet so loved by his kin deserved better. Even in death, even if an enemy of our people.
> And so we brought the body of the Snow Prince, wrapped in fine silks, to a freshly dug barrow. The gleaming armor and spear were presented on a pedestal of honor, and the tomb was arrayed with treasures worthy of royalty. All of the mighty chieftains agreed with this course, that the Elf should be so honored. His body would be preserved in the barrow for as long as the earth chose, but would not be offered ==the protection of our Stalhrim, which was reserved for Nord dead alone.==

> In my native High Rock, traditions dating back to the witch kings and nomadic horsemen mandate ==cremation== of the dead. This is practiced almost without exception in the north, through an ==Imperial burial in a tomb or city cemetery== is more common in the south.

> [!quote] Ancestors and the Dunmer
> The Altmeri and Bosmeri cultures also venerate their ancestors, but only by respecting the orderly and blissful passage of these spirits from this world to the next. That is, Wood Elves and High Elves believe it is cruel and unnatural to encourage the spirits of the dead to linger in our world. Even more grotesque and repugnant is the display of the bodily remains of ancestors in ghost fences and ash pits. The presentation of fingerbones in a family shrine, for example, is sacrilegious to ==the Bosmer (who eat their dead)== and barbaric to the ==Altmer (who inter their dead)==.

> [!quote] PGE3 Summerset
> Within the glittering walls of the Tower are housed the graves of the early Aldmeri settlers, preserved forever as a lasting symbol of the power of the people for that brief moment in history, fully unified.

> [!quote] PGE3 Other Lands
> The highest towers are reserved for interring the dead, a tradition continued on in the Crystal Tower itself.

> When the Redguards came to Tamriel in 1E 808, they brought with them a tradition of burying their criminals on islands off their shore, to prevent their evil spirits from disturbing the living.
