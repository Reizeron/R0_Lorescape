Most of our info on Camlorn comes from the [[Mystery of Talara]] book series:

> [!quote]- Mystery of Talara
> 1. The year was 3E 405. The occasion was the millennial celebration of the founding of the Breton Kingdom of Camlorn.
> 2. Every grand boulevard and narrow alley was strung with ==gold and purple== banners, some plain, some marked with the heraldic symbols of the Royal Family...
> 3. A thousand comely young women, brightly and provocatively dressed, danced their way down the ==long, wide main street== of the city, from the ==Temple of Sethiete to the Royal Palace==. 
> 4. So it was long before the sun had set that the prostitutes turned dancers were at ==Cavilstyr Rock.== It was a ==great, wide promontory facing the sea==
> 5. To be honest, I don't remember anything at all of my childhood before I was nine or ten.
> 6. She turned back to Gyna, her eyes welling with tears. "==The entire royal family of Camlorn was assassinated over twenty years ago==. My father was ==Duke of Oloine==, the King's brother, and so he inherited the crown.
> 7. She nodded, remembering who she was. Eight years of darkness lifted.
> 8. She was still close to the ==rocky shoreline== of the capitol city of the kingdom of Camlorn, but the water had carried her quite a ways from the point where she fell at Cavilstyr Rock.
> 9. Her father who was then Duke of Oloine sent her to a ==sanitarium== in the country to get well.
> 10. Gnorbooth was leaving his favorite pub in Camlorn, ==The Breaking Branch==, when he heard someone calling his name. His was not the sort of a name that could be mistaken for another. He turned and saw ==Lord Eryl==, the Royal Battlemage from the palace, emerge from the darkness of the alley.
> 11. he knew he must find his way to ==Umbington== before Lord Eryl's agents did.
> 12. ==The Prostitutes Guildhouse of Camlorn== was a great palace in an ==affluent northern quarter of the city==. ==Prince Sylon== could have found his way there blindfolded
> 13. It was a letter to the Emperor the late king your brother was penning at the time of his assassination, concerning a thief ==who had once been a mage-priest== at the ==Temple of Sethiete== here in Camlorn. His name was ==Jagar Tharn==... "It is dated on the day of his assassination in the year 385. Four years before Jagar Tharn betrayed his master, and began the ten years of tyranny of the Imperial Simulacrum."
> 14. Tharn had stolen many books of powerful and forgotten spells, and lore about such artifacts as the Staff of Chaos, where it was hidden and how it could be used.

> [!quote]- TES Arena Mines of Khuras quest
> I welcome you to the [[Brotherhood of Seth]], [player name]. Word of your inquiries concerning the [[Crypt of Hearts]] has come to my attention. I am [[Halfas Varn]], senior Brother in this temple. I would gladly help you on your quest, but dire times are upon us. One of our brethren, [[Barnabas of Tethis]], went mad, raving that the Emperor had been captured! He insisted that only something called the Staff of Chaos could free the Emperor from his fate. Naturally we did not believe him, he was ever one live in fanciful dreams. Instead, we tried our best to soothe him, talking to him of brighter, happier things. We thought he was fine."
> 
> "Yesterday afternoon he went berserk and killed Brother Martinus, then fled from the temple. With him he took a scroll that he claimed would help him find a piece of the missing so-called Staff of Chaos. I fear he has gone to the [[Mines of Khuras]], the place where he claimed the map said he would find his first clue. What he doesn't realized is that the map he carries was originally found in the Mines. Part of the inscription on the map is a code that we planned to use to decipher the location of the Crypt of Hearts from the Elder Scrolls. Without that map, we haven't a chance. If only there was a way of recovering the map, but the Mines of Khuras are too dangerous. Poor Brother Barnabas has surely perished by now. I will tell you how to get to the Mines. There you can search for the map, or Brother Barnabas. I think it unlikely that you will find either, but there is always a slim chance. If you return to me with the map, I will tell you the location of the Crypt of Hearts. It is a fool's errand, but such is your only hope. Do you wish to search the Mines?"
