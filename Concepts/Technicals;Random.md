Royal Dome of Wayrest
the fifth birthday of Princess Tymona, and parades and celebrations in her honor were held throughout Wayrest
Her brother Eadwyre was old enough to know that his mother was an expert at manipulating the populace. It was a trait he was eager to learn at her feet.
Elysana turned before going to meet with the Magister of the Wayrest Mages Guild. ‘I will expect a full report of your progress every morning, Herwyn.’
The Queen could see her heir Eadwyre, whom she called Wyre
Elysana, Queen of Wayrest, is at her court, the Royal Dome. She has been receiving regular visits from the ghost of her father, and has launched a full investigation, suspecting necromancy. Her Spymaster Herwyn Brant and the Archmagister of the Mages Guild Hannibal Traven have indeed found Necromancers in Wayrest, but they are not responsible for the situation. She has asked her Spymaster to redouble the search for Tris Gaerington, and also to check on her husband's mistress to make certain she is the fool she seems to be.

Elysana, Queen of Wayrest, was in her hidden castle, the one she had last occupied while her old palace in the city was being torn down and the Dome was being constructed.

"Laurent Lyonswurst," the young man smiled, and shook Tris's hand with his own meaty one. The name did sound familiar. The Lyonswursts were a prominent family in Wayrest, though most of them were arrested by Elysana a few years after becoming Queen, as they had been sympathetic to Helseth's claim to the throne.

“I’m just not sure it gives the right message to diplomats,” the Queen of Wayrest’s consort, Prince Cayler was saying. “I mean, a huge rotting corpse …”

Prince Eadwyre, called "Wyre," was there, a handsome little boy in black velvet. His five year old sister Princess Tymona was old enough to act properly serious.

The Prince knew that Bretons and other men usually buried their dead underground, but the wealthy did it as the Altmer did, in structures built to house them. All the funerals he had ever been to had been at the Crystal Tower …

**The Chapel of Akatosh, The Royal Dome of Wayrest**

The Queen's personal chapel in the Royal Dome was big enough to be a cathedral, though like most churches to Akatosh, it was not the wide open, vaulted arrangement of the other Nine. The ceilings were comparatively low, crisscrossed with columns, so it seemed like a cross between a maze and a cave. Footfall always echoed.

Persons concerned with the Will of Count Sternhart were led through the chapel by one of the priests, to the sancristy and hall of records in the back, behind the fearsome stone statue of the Dragon God of Time.

The Sancristy was no less cave-like, particularly as being a part of the curvilinear arrangement of all parts of the Dome of Wayrest.

King Helseth of Morrowind, as the six month summary of his kingdom has suggested, has been quite busy lately. Always up to now, he has been a political and diplomatic warrior, but now he has shown himself to be an adept commander, tactician, and fighter. The months following his near death illness spent sparring have made him stronger and more resilient than ever. He has not spent much time at home in Mournhold, but those who have seen him, even people who did not know what to make of him before, say he strikes an inspirationally regal figure, and is much beloved of his army.

Queen Dinara and her mother-in-law the Queen Mother Barenziah remain in Mournhold, in charge of the other aspects of ruling the realm. They are doing an excellent job, bringing in diplomats from the allied Houses and the Imperial Court to keep relations tight, and helping those whose lives had been shattered by the war, distributing food and leading rebuilding efforts, beginning in Bal Therec. Dinara particularly is the heart behind these efforts, and though she does her duties with diligence, her brother Obael’s captivity has caused her many sleepless nights.

Queen Elysana of Wayrest, as described before, is continuing with her alliance with Orsinium – though, of course, she has not giving up her spy network, and gets regular intelligence from Herwyn about the orcs, as well as the other potential threats throughout High Rock and Tamriel. She has been sharing some of what she’s learned about Helseth’s battle plans with the Redoran and Indoril, which is one of the factors keeping the southern Dres lands in Indoril possession.

King Gothryd and Queen Aubk-I of Daggerfall had their fifth child recently, whom they named Laurent, after their court favorite, found brutally murdered on a country road some time ago.

Quill, formerly Dygbal of Ivytyde, continues to run the Quill Traveling Circus, and his dark-humored entertainment has become much lighter since he learned he was to become a father. Still, he won’t allow Mirea to do any more acrobatic than jugglings and clowning until after the child is born.


"You will have to be more specific," Morgiah replied. "Twenty years ago in Wayrest, I was a Princess in the court of King Eadwyre and my mother Queen Barenziah. My brother and stepsister were vying for the throne, and I lent him my support as I always did. But I had my own future to think of, and a Dunmer Princess has relatively few prospects. In High Rock, despite my family's high position, we were not welcome in Wayrest, a fact that was proven when Helseth lost his fight to become King. If I returned to Morrowind, I would be mettling in my mother and brother's alternate plan. So I set my sights elsewhere.

"Reman had just become King of Firsthold on the death of his brother, who had been slain by the necromantic forces of Mannimarco. The King of Worms has long plagued this land. But though Reman and I cared for one another, we could not be married, for his Altmer subjects would not allow a Dunmeri Queen on the throne. I told him that if he would fight for me, I would fight for him.

"He does not know what I did. I lied to him, telling him that the Gods of my people, the Tribunal, vanquished Mannimarco. In truth, I sought him out, and asked him what service I could perform so he would leave Firsthold, and he asked for my first born child.

"I did not agree at first, but I could see that Elysana would win Wayrest, and my possibilities were few. And so, Stendarr forgive me, I agreed.

"Reman was so overjoyed that Mannimarco had gone that he made the marriage happen, despite all opposition. And when my sources, such as the sload you met in the mirror, assured me that the King of Worms was gone, I allowed myself to get pregnant."

The bustling squares of Wayrest were like no bazaar Faryon had ever seen. Here more than any other place, the merchant-prince ruled. Anything that could be had anywhere, could be found in Wayrest. From the east up the Bjoulsae River, or from the west down the Iliac Bay, commodities and ephemera of every variety collided.

Had Faryon been used to the city, he would have noticed how much it had changed. It had always been a wealthy, mercantile center, but now there were nearly as many orcs wandering the streets and selling their goods as there were Bretons. The alliance between Elysana and Gortwog gro-Nagorm had changed the culture enormously.

The great royal Dome of Wayrest dominated the skyline. Upon arriving there and giving his name, Faryon received a much different reception that at the Imperial Palace, where it had taken him weeks to receive a reception with the Emperor's son. Only a few minutes went by, and the guard hurried back.

>[[Jagar Tharn]]'s goal was simple actually -- the disintegration of [[the Emрire]]. Slow. Gradual. The people of Tamriel would languish under an ineffectual monarch he played splendidly and eventually rebel, one by one, dissolving the Septims domain and returning the Arena to its natural state. Tharn even placated the Lord of Destruction and bought valuable time by giving him [[the Battlespire]]. The plan was calculated and put in motion, but it was not meant to be.

> Let me share a bit of [[Valenwood lore]] with you. Did you know that healers there use maggots to treat festering wounds? The little larvae eat away all the dead and rotting flesh leaving the wound pink and clean. Not a pretty sight, painful too, but beneficial in the long run. [[Jagar Tharn]]'s plan was much like that, but the people of the Empire, in their ignorace, preferred to kill the maggot and stitch the rotting wound back together. Now the rot has to be burned out with hot iron instead.

>Meridia, the Secret Fire, is considered the mother of life, purity, and potential in Bretonic culture. Once a lover of Auri-El, she broke with him for assisting Sheor in creation. Too proud to flee with her father Magnus, she carved out a sphere in Oblivion from which she challenges the free will of man. Her followers are known to be haughty and spiteful of displays of individuality, yet hold an unrivaled passion for life itself, considering it their duty to destroy all which corrupts its ideal forms.

>Namira the Ghost-Eater is considered the mother of dualisms, disorder, and decay in Bretonic culture. It is said she was born when Sheor looked upon her void-veiled form and felt inspired to introduce struggle to his creation. With struggle came death, and she fed upon the souls of its victims until Arkay's intervention. Her followers are known to be contemptuous of mortal life, actively infringing on the laws of Arkay to satiate their goddess with forlorn souls and ultimately escape the cycle themselves.

> In Bretonic culture, Mehrunes Dagon the Blood-King is associated with droughts -- he once drained all the oceans of Nirn, before Kynareth filled them back with her tears -- and the horrors of war. His unruly, iconoclastic followers see Mehrunes Dagon as an engine of perpetual revolution leading to the ultimate form of liberation. Popular uprisings against the clergy and feudal lords have historically been inspired by Dagonite philosophies.

>The Dunmer hate necromancy and the undead, and hate blood vampires in particular. Blood vampires are powerful undead creatures that feed on humanoid blood. The vampire curse is contracted from disease-contaminated blood; victims of vampire attacks sometimes become vampires. There is no known cure for vampirism but the destruction of the vampire. Ash vampires are not blood vampires; though both are powerful immortal undead, ash vampire do not feed on blood, and have no connection with blood vampires.
>**(continue)**
>Imperial culture regards blood vampires as destructive monsters to be hunted and destroyed. However, romantic notions of noble, virtuous vampires persist in Imperial traditions, and vampires are thought to pass unrecognized in the Mages Guild and the Imperial aristocracy.
