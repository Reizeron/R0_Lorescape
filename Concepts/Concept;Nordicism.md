The "official" historic view of the Empire, plays into the larger "Arcturian vs Imperial" narrative.

> The usual Imperial arrogance. The hoary old "Out of Atmora" theory has been widely discredited (no reputable archaeologist would publicly support it these days), but the Imperial Geographers continue to beat the drum of the Nordic Fatherland in the best tradition of the Septim Empire. They seem to think that the imprimature of officialdom gives their outdated scholarship added weight -- which, unfortunately, it appears to in the eyes of the ever-gullible public which continues to snap up the latest Pocket Guides along with the rest of their Imperial Certified pablum. - Hasphat Antabolis

> **Antabolis Hasphat** (Kurt Kuhlmann): I would not take the ravings of this "Michael" too seriously. He has never been published in the Journal of Ancient Tamrielic History, and was dismissed from the his position at the University of Gwylim for persisting in reading aloud portions of the long-debunked "Monkey Truth" during faculty meetings.

> *Chimer (precursor to Dunmer) is KY-mare. Means 'Changed Folk.' Oops! This is a secret..!*
> 
> All modern scholars agree that Chimer means "Crafty Folk". "Changed Folk" is rank speculation based on early reports from the excavation of Dagon Fell (which I supervised), and has been resoundingly disproven in my recently published article, "Dunmer and Chimer in the Mythic Era: A Social History" (JATH 5897.3).


> Remember that the ‘first era' is a Human demarcation of time. The Elder Races have their own divisions (and diversions) of history. Furthermore, the human eras do not conveniently begin and end with a single empire each time. The Second Empire of Reman had its genesis in the first era, too, some 2000 years after the War of Succession, and it was far more significant than the tyranny of the early Nords.
> The “First Empire of Skyrim” is somewhat of a fabrication. The heirs of King Harald, while they had many holdings in foreign lands, never regarded themselves as anything more than a strong and steady line of successful war-chieftains. During the foundation of the Septim regime, certain parties thought it necessary to retrofit Skyrim's early history into something that might legitimize Talos' ascension to a traditionally Nedic throne (the general's Atmoran lineage was well known). The infamous “Coronation Edition of the Pocket Guide to the Empire” is the best example of this revisionism gone mad.
> If the first era must “belong” to any one nation of Tamriel, then it is, of course, Cyrodiil. The Empire of Reman lasted for approx. 600 years (long into the next era); after its passing the world suffered through dark times. Before Reman, the world had been held in thrall by the Order, which, while technically not overseen by the (then) current Cyrodilic Emperor, was tied into the first Nibenese Empress, St. Alessia (the Manifold Manifest).
