This project is an extercise in a bottom-up, dialogue-driven kind of worldbuilding for the Elder Scrolls, using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

The dialogue system in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind has always been criticized as very generic due to the fact that the NPCs in that game share a common, if large, pool of dialogue text lines between themselves and instead of dialogue trees made of lines specific to certain NPCs it felt more like reading a wikipedia, especially since the lines were connected among themselves through automatic hyperlinks.

So I thought, why not embrace this "wikipedia" functionality and try to do some worldbuilding within this system? Instead of treating generic in-game dialogue as an afterthought, why not make it the cornerstone of your lore project? Instead of writing articles or in-game texts like I've seen many approach TES lorebuilding doing, you'd build a network of short (512 characters max) interconnected dialogue responses.

I believe that could provide a more organic kind of worldbuildind, especially since another neat part of Morrowind dialogue system is filtering the lines based on the speaker's various qualities - sex, race, class, faction etc. Obviously a commoner's idea of a certain concept could be completely different to that of a scholar, and in Morrowind dialogue you commonly see different classes provididng different information when asked about the same topic.

For my first attempt at this kind of worlbuilding I've chosen the Province of High Rock, for no particular reason really, other than me being interested in the local lore at the moment.
